Nice — I’ll write this like a **serious EVM product README**, the kind that instantly signals *“this is not a toy project”*.

You can copy-paste this directly into `README.md` and tweak names later.

# 🧵 ChainSupply

**On-chain Inventory & Production Management for Manufacturing**

ChainSupply is a **production-grade inventory management platform** designed for manufacturing companies and powered by **EVM smart contracts deployed on Base**.

It bridges **real-world manufacturing workflows** (raw materials → production → finished goods → distribution) with **on-chain transparency, auditability, and trust**.

---

## 🌍 Why ChainSupply?

Traditional inventory systems are:

* Opaque
* Easy to manipulate
* Hard to audit
* Fragmented across teams

ChainSupply brings **verifiable inventory records on-chain**, ensuring:

* Immutable stock movement history
* Transparent production tracking
* Tamper-proof audit trails
* Real-time visibility across warehouses

Built specifically with **manufacturing at scale** in mind (cotton wool, diapers, sanitary pads).

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

ChainSupply is a **hybrid on-chain + off-chain system**:

### On-Chain (Base Network)

* Immutable inventory events
* Batch creation & production records
* Stock movement proofs
* Role & permission anchors
* Audit trail guarantees

### Off-Chain

* High-performance APIs
* Business logic & validations
* Reporting & analytics
* User experience & dashboards

This approach keeps gas costs low while preserving trust guarantees.

## 🏭 Manufacturing Use Case

ChainSupply supports end-to-end manufacturing workflows:

### Raw Materials

* Pulp
* Chemicals
* Non-woven fabric
* Elastic materials
* Packaging

### Production

* Batch-based production
* Bill of Materials (BOM)
* Material consumption tracking
* Output verification on-chain

### Finished Goods

* Cotton wool
* Diapers (variants & sizes)
* Sanitary pads (variants & sizes)
* SKU & batch tracking

### Warehousing

* Multi-warehouse support
* Stock transfers
* Adjustments & reconciliation
* Low-stock alerts

---

## 🔐 Roles & Permissions

* **Admin** – Full system access
* **Inventory Manager** – Stock & warehouse control
* **Production Manager** – Batch & BOM management
* **Sales** – Outbound stock & distribution

Critical actions are **anchored on-chain** for auditability.

---

## 📦 Core Features

* ✅ On-chain inventory event logging
* ✅ Batch-based production tracking
* ✅ Multi-warehouse stock management
* ✅ Immutable audit trail
* ✅ Role-based access control
* ✅ Real-time stock visibility
* ✅ Gas-efficient event design
* 🚧 Advanced analytics (coming soon)
* 🚧 Supplier on-boarding (coming soon)

---

## 📜 Smart Contracts

Contracts are deployed on **Base** and handle:

* Inventory movement events
* Batch creation records
* Production confirmations
* Role assignments
* Audit references

Contracts are designed to be:

* Minimal
* Gas-efficient
* Upgrade-safe (via versioned deployments)

> ⚠️ Business logic lives off-chain. The chain is used as the **source of truth**, not a computation engine.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js ≥ 18
* PostgreSQL
* MetaMask wallet
* Base network RPC

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pnpm start:dev
```

### Frontend

## 🔗 Network Configuration

* **Network:** Base
* **Chain ID:** 8453
* **Currency:** ETH
* **Explorer:** Basescan

Contracts are deployed and verified on Base.

---

## 🔍 Auditing & Transparency

Every critical inventory action emits an **on-chain event**:

* Stock In
* Stock Out
* Transfers
* Production Batches
* Adjustments

This enables:

* Independent verification
* Regulatory audits
* Dispute resolution
* Trustless reporting

---

## 🧪 Testing

* Unit tests for smart contracts
* Integration tests for backend
* Role-based flow testing
* Event indexing validation

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

* 🔜 Supplier onboarding on-chain
* 🔜 DAO-based governance for factories
* 🔜 Zero-knowledge inventory proofs
* 🔜 Multi-chain expansion
* 🔜 ERP integrations
